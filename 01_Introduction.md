# # What is Machine Learning ??

Machin leraning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" with data, without being explicitly programmed.

## 1. Supervised Machine Learning

A machine learning technique in which a model is trained using labeled data, where each input is associated with a known output, so that the model can learn to predict correct outputs for new, unseen inputs.

## Types of Supervised Machine Learning

### (i) Classification 

- Classification is a type of supervised learning in which the output is a category or class (Categorical Data).
- The model predicts a class from predefined categories.

#### Example : 
> - Email → Spam / Not Spam
> - Student result → Pass / Fail

### (ii) Regression 

- Regression is a type of supervised learning in which the output is a continuous numerical (Numerical Data).
- The model predicts a numeric value.

#### Example : 
> - Predicting house price
> - Predicting marks based on study hours

## 2. UnSupervised Machine Learning

A type of machine learning in which the model is trained on unlabeled data, meaning there is no predefined output. The model automatically finds patterns, groups, or relationships in the data.

## Types of UnSupervised Machine Learning


### (i) Clustering 

- A technique that groups unlabeled data into clusters based on similarity.
- Its goal is to discover patterns or relationships within the data without any prior knowledge of categories or labels.
- Groups data points that share similar features or characteristics.

#### Example :
> An online store collects customer data such as age, income, and shopping behavior without any labels.  
> A clustering algorithm groups customers into clusters like:
> - Budget customers
> - Regular customers
> - Premium customers
> 
> This helps the company understand customer types without predefined categories.
