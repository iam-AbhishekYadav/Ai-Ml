# # Types of Machine Learning 

Types of Machine Learning on the basis of How is the machine learning model trained ? especially on production.

## 1. Batch (Offline) Learning

- A training approach where the model is trained once on a fixed dataset.
- After training, the model is deployed and used for predictions, but it does not learn continuously from new data unless it is retrained again from scratch (or with an updated dataset).
