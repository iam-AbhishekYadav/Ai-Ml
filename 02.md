# # Types of Machine Learning 

Types of Machine Learning on the basis of `How is the machine learning model trained ? especially on production.`

## 1. Batch (Offline) Learning

- A training approach where the model is trained once on a fixed dataset.
- After training, the model is deployed and used for predictions, but it does not learn continuously from new data unless it is retrained again from scratch (or with an updated dataset).

### How It Works (Step-by-Step)

- Collect a large dataset
- Train the model offline (not in real-time)
- Evaluate or Test the model
- Deploy the trained model
- Use it for predictions
- When new data comes → retrain the model again

### Problem/Disadvantages with Batch Learning 

- Model becomes outdated with new data
- Retraining is time-consuming
- Not suitable for real-time systems
- **Hardware Limitation** : Requires high computational resources.



## 2. Online Learning

- A machine learning approach where the model learns continuously, updating itself step-by-step as new data arrives.


### How It Works (Step-by-Step)

- Model is trained with initial data
- New data arrives (one by one or in small batches)
- Model updates its parameters immediately
- Predictions improve over time
- No need to retrain the model from scratch

### When to Use ?

- Data arrives continuously
- Dataset is very large or infinite
- Hardware resources are limited
- Real-time prediction is required
